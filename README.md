# Fit-Lit 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here we built a fitness dashboard to display a random user's info. This includes their hydration, sleep, and step activity along with their personal info. We have used FETCH to pull user data from the internet, rather than having hard coded data. Our app is dyslexic and color blind friendly.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Go to [this repository](https://github.com/cieragrace/fit-lit/) on Github
2. Click "Fork", then "Create New Fork"
3. Click "Code"
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type "git clone" and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in your text editor
8. In your terminal, run "npm install", "npm start", then go to "http://localhost:8080/" in your browser
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

### Learning Goals:

- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using classes) and DOM display
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
- Work with an API along with fetch calls and promises
- We worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub workflow, API

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins
- We got through all 4 iterations
- We had good communication and maintained a positive work environment
- We navigated working together and adapted to different team enironments (splitting off into pairs, working all together, etc...)

#### Challenges 
- We utilised help from our mentors and peers when we were unable to come up with a solution
- We all have different schedules, and had to adjust to family/friends/health
