# Fit-Lit 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here we built a fitness dashboard to display a random user's info. This includes their hydration, sleep, and activity data, along with their personal info. Users can add new data to their information by using the form that's on the page. Our app is dyslexic and color blind friendly, and is fully tabable.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Go to [this repository](https://github.com/cieragrace/fit-lit/) on Github
2. Click "Fork", then "Create New Fork"
3. Click "Code"
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type "git clone" and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in your text editor
8. In your terminal, run "npm install", "npm start", then go to "http://localhost:8080/" in your browser
9. You will also need to clone down the API server. Go to [the API repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fitlit-api) and follow steps 3-8
10. You can now manipulate the application in the browser window

### Learning Goals:

- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using classes) and DOM display
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
- Work with an API along with fetch calls and promises

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub
- GitHub Projects
- Webpack
- APIs
- Chart.js
- Day.js

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins
- We got through all 5 iterations, and completed an extension by implementing Chart.js
- We had good communication and maintained a positive work environment
- We navigated working together and adapted to different team environments (paired programming, mob coding, etc...)
- We utilized help from our mentors and peers when we were unable to come up with a solution
#### Challenges 
- The POST requests were especially difficult to figure out. We didn't know how to add functionality for them, so we had to bring in some outside help.
- We all have different schedules, and had to adjust to family/friends/health
