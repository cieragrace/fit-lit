// A UserRepository holds onto all of the User objects
// It should have a parameter to take in user data

//parameters:
//data

//properties:
//this.data or this.userData -> something like that




// It should have methods to determine:

// Given a userâ€™s ID, what is their user data?
        //go through the users
        //return the corresponding user object when its found
        //now we have access to their info


// The average step goal amongst all users
        //go through each user
        //possibly use reduce method?
        //get total daily step goal number
        //divide by user count
